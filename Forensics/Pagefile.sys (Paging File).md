## ✅ **What is it?**

`Pagefile.sys` (also called the **paging file**) is a **virtual memory file** used by Windows to store **data from RAM when physical memory is full**. It temporarily holds:

- **Running processes and data swapped out of RAM**.
- **Passwords, encryption keys, and login credentials**.
- **Fragments of executed malware or scripts**.
- **URLs, file paths, and chat messages from open applications**.

Forensically, **Pagefile.sys is a goldmine** because:

- It may store **remnants of memory-resident malware**.
- It can contain **decrypted credentials** from security tools.
- It provides a **snapshot of past system activity**.

> **⚠️ Limitations:**
> 
> - The paging file is **overwritten frequently** as Windows manages memory.
> - On SSDs, **TRIM may erase stored data faster**.
> - **Full reconstruction of processes is difficult**, as only fragments are available.

## **📍 Where to Find It?**

Pagefile.sys is stored in the system root:

```
C:\pagefile.sys
```

By default, it is **protected by Windows**, so **direct access requires admin privileges**.

## **🛠️ How to Extract It (Step by Step)**

We will use **FTK Imager** to extract Pagefile.sys and **Volatility** to analyze its contents.

### **Method 1: Manual Extraction**

1. **Change File Permissions**
    
    - Open **Command Prompt as Administrator**.
    - Run:
        
        ```cmd
        takeown /F C:\pagefile.sys
        icacls C:\pagefile.sys /grant Administrators:F
        ```
        
    - This allows access to the file.
2. **Copy Pagefile.sys to a Working Directory**
    
    ```cmd
    copy C:\pagefile.sys C:\Temp\pagefile.sys
    ```

### **Method 2: Automated Extraction with FTK Imager**

#### **1️⃣ Download FTK Imager**

- Get it from **[Exterro FTK Imager](https://accessdata.com/product-download/ftk-imager-version-4-3-0)**.
- Install and launch the tool.

#### **2️⃣ Create a Forensic Image**

- Click **File > Add Evidence Item**.
- Select **Physical Drive** and locate **C:\pagefile.sys**.
- Choose **Export Raw Data** and save it as **pagefile.raw**.

### **Method 3: Analyzing Pagefile.sys with Volatility**

#### **1️⃣ Download Volatility**

- Get it from **[The Volatility Foundation](https://www.volatilityfoundation.org/)**.

#### **2️⃣ Extract Text from Pagefile.sys**

Run the following command to extract readable strings:

```cmd
strings -n 8 C:\Temp\pagefile.sys > C:\ExtractedResults\pagefile_strings.txt
```

- This will pull **potential passwords, URLs, and commands**.

#### **3️⃣ Search for Suspicious Data**

- Open **pagefile_strings.txt** in **Notepad++**.
- Look for:
    - **User credentials** (`password`, `login`, `key=`, `token`).
    - **Chat messages, emails, and URLs**.
    - **Malware artifacts** (e.g., references to `mimikatz.exe`).
