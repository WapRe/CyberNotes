## ‚úÖ **What is it?**

Jump Lists are **Windows artifacts that track recently accessed files and applications**. They are automatically created by Windows when a user **opens files via the Start Menu, Taskbar, or File Explorer**.

Forensically, they provide:

- **User activity tracking** (recently accessed files and apps).
- **Evidence of document or program usage** (even if files were deleted).
- **Insight into user habits and workflow**.

> **‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations:**
> 
> - Jump Lists **only track files opened through shortcuts (pinned apps, Start Menu, Taskbar)**.
> - If an application is launched **via Command Prompt or PowerShell**, it may not appear in Jump Lists.
> - They can be **manually cleared** by the user.

## **üìç Where to Find It?**

Jump Lists are stored in:

```
C:\Users\%USERNAME%\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Recent\AutomaticDestinations\
C:\Users\%USERNAME%\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Recent\CustomDestinations\
```

There are two types of Jump Lists:

|**Type**|**Location**|**Purpose**|
|---|---|---|
|**AutomaticDestinations**|`Recent\AutomaticDestinations\`|Auto-generated by Windows for frequently used applications.|
|**CustomDestinations**|`Recent\CustomDestinations\`|Created when users manually pin items to the Taskbar.|

- Files in these directories are **binary `.automaticDestinations-ms` and `.customDestinations-ms` files**.
- The filenames consist of **hexadecimal values** (representing the associated application).

## **üõ†Ô∏è How to Extract It (Step by Step)**

We will use **JLParser**, a forensic tool for parsing Jump Lists.

### **Method 1: Manual Collection**

1. **Navigate to the Jump List Directory**
    
    - Open **File Explorer**.
    - Go to:
        
        ```
        C:\Users\%USERNAME%\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Recent\
        ```
        
    - Copy both `AutomaticDestinations` and `CustomDestinations` folders.
2. **Identify Application Associations**
    
    - The filenames are **hashed representations** of applications.
    - Example:
        
        ```
        5f7b5f1e01b83767.automaticDestinations-ms  ‚Üí  Microsoft Word
        ```
        
    - The hash-to-app mapping is documented in forensic references (or manually determined by checking contents).

### **Method 2: Automated Extraction with JLParser**

#### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Download JLParser**

- Get it from **[Forensic 4cast GitHub](https://github.com/forensicmatt/JLParser)**.
- Extract the files into a working directory.

#### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Run JLParser on Jump Lists**

Navigate to the tool‚Äôs directory and run:

```cmd
JLParser.exe -d C:\Users\%USERNAME%\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Recent\ -o C:\ExtractedResults
```

- `-d` specifies the directory containing Jump Lists.
- `-o` defines the output folder for parsed data.

#### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Review Extracted Data**

- The results will be saved as **CSV files**, showing:
    - **Application name** associated with each Jump List.
    - **Timestamps of last file access**.
    - **File paths of accessed documents**.

## **üìä How to Analyze It (Step by Step)**

|**Step**|**Action**|**Details**|
|---|---|---|
|**1. Open the Parsed Output**|Load the `.csv` file generated by JLParser|Use Excel or a forensic text editor.|
|**2. Identify Opened Files**|Look at the `File Path` column|Shows **recently accessed files**.|
|**3. Review Timestamps**|Check `Last Accessed Time`|Determines when a file was last opened.|
|**4. Link Files to Applications**|Correlate hashed filenames with known apps|Helps determine what programs were used.|
|**5. Investigate Deleted Files**|Check if files listed in Jump Lists still exist|May reveal deleted or moved documents.|
|**6. Correlate with Other Artifacts**|Compare with Registry Hives and Prefetch|Cross-referencing strengthens analysis.|

## **üö® Real-World Use Cases**

### **üìå Incident Response**

- Identify if a **sensitive document was opened** before a breach.
- Confirm whether a user accessed **unauthorized files**.

### **üìå Malware Analysis**

- Detect **malware execution paths** if launched via **GUI-based applications**.
- Uncover **files used by attackers** during an intrusion.

### **üìå Insider Threat Investigations**

- Track **employees accessing confidential files**.
- Verify if a user **opened a file that was later deleted**.
